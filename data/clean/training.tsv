It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy. 	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
