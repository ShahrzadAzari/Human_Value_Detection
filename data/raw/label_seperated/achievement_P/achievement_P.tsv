E01061	Intensive livestock farming should disappear	in favor of	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.	1	0	1

E02021	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).	1	0	0
E02025	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	Most of the time migrants have trouble fitting into society because of the language barrier and hate.

Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence.  Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start.  If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially.

The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves.

We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially, and socially sustainable.

E05121	Public transport in EU cities should be free	in favor of	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener.  In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	1	0	0

E07045	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union	in favor of	With highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible. EU agricultural subsidies should be replaced with incentives and support for a sustainable transition. The earlier we abandon these unfair and highly unsustainable subsidies the better for our own future health, social development, and climate future. Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,  	1	0	0
E07059	The EU should strengthen development cooperation.	in favor of	Europe as a whole is the world’s leading donor. The European Union should strengthen the development cooperation action, focusing on inclusive development	1	0	0
E07078	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation	in favor of	People are willing to volunteer change in relation to involuntary inflicted changes, such as technology, economy, and climate. With this in mind, I hope a European Constitution will be long-lasting and help the people. We have to react to the circumstances and start fast.  	1	0	0
E07079	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene	in favor of	EU should show more strength when dealing with foreign powers. In addition, there should be a vision about where we want to go in the long term with the EU, and this is in an increasingly complex (and sometimes hostile) world. 	1	0	0
E07092	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe	in favor of	An EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past. 	1	1	0
E07105	We need a single immigration policy.	in favor of	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.   	1	0	0
E07110	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance	in favor of	We need to revisit the idea of a defense union that is independent of NATO. National armies of EU states should be able to cooperate. This includes the same equipment, the same training and the same battle language.  	1	0	0
E07121	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union	in favor of	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas. 	1	0	0
E07126	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state	in favor of	Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state coordinated act of the EU, USA, Japan, and Australia. That will make any retaliation from China much more difficult. 	1	0	0
E07128	The demographic decline should be stopped.	in favor of	The EU is in demographic decline. At the start of the 19th century, Europe accounted for 15% of the world's population. By 2050, it will be 5%. 	1	0	0
E07132	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society	in favor of	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.	1	0	0
E07136	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity	in favor of	Without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.	1	0	0
E07153	The 19 June plenary meeting of the European Conference should mark a first step in the direction of a stronger and more united EU in the world	in favor of	We need the United States of Europe. A European army, strategic autonomy, and acting as one. To the future of Europe must belong its capacity to act as a global player.  	1	1	0
E07157	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need.	in favor of	Africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55.  It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	1	1	1
E07163	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.	in favor of	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	1	1	0
E07172	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately 	in favor of	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	1	0	0
E07173	We need an integrated migration and border policy.	in favor of	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.	1	0	0
E07179	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.	in favor of	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	1	0	0
E07189	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union.	in favor of	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	1	0	0
E07190	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council	in favor of	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy. 	1	1	0
E07191	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council	in favor of	It should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.	1	1	0
E07193	We need better ways of migration.	in favor of	Migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.    	1	0	0
E07194	We need better ways of migration.	in favor of	The EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection. 	1	0	0
E07196	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.	in favor of	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.	1	1	0
E07197	We need a stand-alone European army.	in favor of	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.  	1	0	0
E07211	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism	in favor of	The EU should be able to contribute to a relaunch of global multilateralism, through a profound reform based on democracy and peace, solidarity, and respect for human, social, and environmental rights.	1	0	0
E07215	The EU should change its internal structure.	in favor of	Expansion by many dissimilar members and in particular the implementation of the EURO has made the EU unmanageable.  The EURO is too strong for the less competitive members and is therefore unsustainable.  	1	0	0
E07224	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.	in favor of	We need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure. 	1	1	0
E07227	The EU needs a single market for news	in favor of	We have a deficit in democracy in the EU because of the lack of coverage of European affairs in our media. It's also the reason why people don't know much about the EU and don't understand how it benefits us all.	1	0	0
E07228	 Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity	in favor of	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	1	1	0
E07233	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.	in favor of	Only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy. The EU should develop fair cooperation with the African Union and also offer Africa an alternative to the geopolitical attempts of other powers to establish themselves as global hegemons. 	1	1	0
E07243	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.	in favor of	France should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.	1	1	0
E07251	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.	in favor of	Giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making. 	1	1	0
E07267	There should be a new EU foreign policy.	in favor of	The stated proposal for a new EU foreign policy is very well thought through.	1	0	0
E07276	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed	in favor of	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).	1	0	1
E08001	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport.	in favor of	Pooling & Sharing increases the size, availability, the diversity of specific military resources but decreases their global cost at the same time	1	0	1
E08002	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport.	in favor of	Pooling & Sharing integrates military capabilities at the European level and creates a European culture in the military sector.	1	1	0
E08004	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states	in favor of	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.	1	1	0
E08015	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states	in favor of	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.	1	0	0
E08016	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states	in favor of	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years.   I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.	1	1	0
